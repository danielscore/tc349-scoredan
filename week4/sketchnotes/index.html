			<h2>What is sketchnoting?</h2>
			<p>Sketchnoting is a technique of drawing(or sketching), notes to get the big picture of ideas.  It sounded very cool to me at the beginning but I personally didn't find it to be very practical.  With exams coming up, I needed to make sure that I got down as many details as possible.  While this was an interesting experience, I don't think I'll continue the use of it.  Below, is the one sketchnote I took.  The site structure has a section to hold many different sketchnotes but I only have the one.</p>
