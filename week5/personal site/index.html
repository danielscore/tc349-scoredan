			<h1>Card Sorting - Personal Site</h1>
		</header>
		<p>My second round of card sorting is for a personal site that I want to create.  This site is meant to be a portfolio/resume site.  To start, I looked around at other resume sites to see stuff that they included.  Some examples of sites I looked at are <a href="http://mtthwbsh.com">mtthwbsh.com</a>, and <a href="http://michaelkulick.net">michaelkulick.net</a>.  On top of getting inspiration from those sites, I also thought about what I personally want to have in the site.  Here are the results from my personal card sorting.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Hire Me
				<ul>
					<li>Email Address</li>
					<li>Services</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Personal
				<ul>
					<li>Activities</li>
					<li>Interests</li>
					<li>Hobbies</li>
					<li>Essays</li>
					<li>Bio</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Portfolio
				<ul>
					<li>School Projects</li>
					<li>Personal Projects</li>
					<li>Github Page Link</li>
					<li>Sketches</li>
					<li>Site Mockups</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Skills
				<ul>
					<li>Programming Skills</li>
					<li>People Skills</li>
					<li>Other Skills</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Work History
				<ul>
					<li>Work Experiences</li>
					<li>Testimonials</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Here are the results from the other participants.</p>

		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>1</th>
				<td>Contact Info</td>
				<td>Hobbies/etc.</td>
				<td>Work History/References</td>
				<td>Work Samples</td>

				<td></td>
			</tr>

				<td>Experience</td>
				<td>Of Personal Interest</td>
				<td>Portfolio</td>
				<td>Services Offered</td>

				<th>4</th>

				<td>Personal</td>
				<td>References</td>
				<td>Skills and Services</td>
				<td></td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>There were 4 other responses.  Although most of the items were put into unique categories, there were 3 groups of items that were in the same category in more than one card sort.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Personal
				<ul>
					<li>Interests</li>
					<li>Hobbies</li>
					<li>Bio</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Portfolio
				<ul>
					<li>School Projects</li>
					<li>Personal Projects</li>
					<li>Sketches</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Skills
				<ul>
					<li>Programming Skills</li>
					<li>People Skills</li>
					<li>Other Skills</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Participant Number 3 made a comment that the About category isn't necessary and I'm inclined to agree. For my information architecture, I will use the categories, Portfolio, Skills, Social/Contact, and Resume.</p>
